# Today I learned

The best way to keep my knowledge tidbits in my brain is to write them down somewhere else! I can easily search them and reference them when I need to.

## Running the md linker script

To create the links in this document, run 'mdlinker.py'. The script tpulls all of the \*.md files, uses the subfolders as categories, creates the links, sorts and then appends them to this file.

```{py}
python3 -m mdlinker
```

# Links to tidbits

* [python:lists](python/lists/sorting-lists.md)
