# Test automation process
Watching Dave Farley's youtube channel, [Continuuous Development](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery/playlists). He has a book on this process, available via [Leanpub.](https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines)

* Automate all regression testing
* Adopt ATDD/BDD for all new work
* Automate any testing required to release

## Acceptance Test Driven Development
Also known as behavior driven development. Dave Farley has a [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuDIYk9GBpE&t=29s) about the topic on his channel. It is not itself a testing technique. Focused on using automated test cases to drive development of production code. The team comes up with the requirements of the application, expressed in a format understandable by everyone, which are turned into automated acceptance tests[^.](https://www.digite.com/agile/acceptance-test-driven-development-atdd/) 

ATDD favors the creation of interfaces specific to functional testing. (Testing through an applicationâ€™s actual UI is considered less effective.)
